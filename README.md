# NFT Marketplace

Our Solar Asset Marketplace is an end-to-end platform for solar asset financing, optimized for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. This platform is a decentralized, open source global market where anyone can buy and sell Solar power assets as `ERC1155` NFTs.
This technology allows for the decentralization of the electricity production, which means that the platform will eliminate middlemen in favor of 
- direct ownership
- profit sharing
- local generation
The Owners of said NFTs are able to generate revenue from selling the electricity the asset generates to consumers in the real world in exchange for stablecoins. The platform also allows any user to track each individual installation and see its performance figures in realtime via their blockchain explorer. We believe that focusing on renewable energy sources is the way forward for humanity if we are to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
